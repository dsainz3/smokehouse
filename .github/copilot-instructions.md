# Copilot Instructions

This repo is a Markdown-based smoking/grilling knowledge base.
Prefer small, focused edits and keep content consistent with existing style.

## What to Generate

- New recipes should start from `TEMPLATE_RECIPE.md` and live under `proteins/` (or `holidays/` when appropriate).
- Add or update the relevant folder `README.md` index link when you add a recipe.
- Use `cooks/` for cook logs (what actually happened), not for the “ideal” recipe.

## Content Guidelines

- Prefer “cook to temperature, not time”. Include target temps and doneness cues.
- Times are estimates; call out variables (thickness, ambient temp, cooker behavior).
- If a step has known options (foil vs butcher paper, sauce timing), note tradeoffs.
- Unicode typography is allowed (→, °F, ½, en dashes). Avoid mojibake.

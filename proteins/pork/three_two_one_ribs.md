## Cook

### Setup

- Temp: **225°F**
- Zone placement: thicker sections toward the hotter right side if needed
- Pan / Grate: on grates, bone side down

### Timing (3-2-1)

1. **3 hours (smoke):** unwrapped at 225°F
   - Spritz every 45–60 minutes after bark starts setting: **75% pineapple juice + 25% water**
2. **2 hours (wrap):** wrap tight (see notes below)
   - In wrap (per rack):
     - **2 tbsp butter**
     - **3 tbsp brown sugar**
     - Splash of **50/50 pineapple juice + water** (enough to wet the wrap contents)
   - If using liquid: **double-wrap foil tight** so it doesn’t leak.
   - If you prefer butcher paper: it’s best for a less “braised” texture, but it won’t hold liquid well—use little/no liquid.
3. **1 hour (finish):** unwrap, return to smoker to reset bark
   - Optional: glaze/sauce during last 15–30 minutes

### Target Temps / Doneness

- Internal temp is a guide (often **195–205°F**), but tenderness matters more.
- Done cues:
  - bend test: rack bends and cracks slightly
  - toothpick slides in with little resistance between bones

---

## Rest

- Duration: **10–20 minutes**
- Method: tent loosely with foil (avoid tight wrap if you want barkier ribs)

# Resting Meat

Resting lets juices redistribute and improves tenderness.

## Typical Rest Times

- Poultry: **10–15 minutes**
- Pork chops: **5–10 minutes**
- Whole birds / roasts: **15–30 minutes**
- Brisket / pork shoulder: **1+ hour** (wrapped + insulated)

## Methods

### Open Rest (Best for Crisp Skin)

- Rest uncovered 5–10 minutes
- Prevents steaming the skin

### Foil Tent

- Tent loosely with foil
- Prevents excessive heat loss

### Towel + Cooler

- Foil wrap (loose), wrap in towels, place in an empty cooler

### Optional Accessory: Insulated BBQ Resting Blanket

- Useful for brisket, pork shoulder, turkey
- Search Amazon for: **"insulated meat resting bag"** or **"BBQ resting blanket"**
- Price varies widely; pick one with solid reviews

## Notes

- For crispy poultry skin: avoid tight foil wrapping during rest.
- For big cuts: insulated rest improves tenderness and slicing.

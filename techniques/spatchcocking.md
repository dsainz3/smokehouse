# Spatchcocking a Fowl (Chicken, Cornish Hen, Turkey)

Spatchcocking (butterflying) removes the backbone so the bird lays flat for faster, more even cooking.

## Tools Needed

- Poultry shears (preferred)
- Cutting board
- Paper towels

## Steps

1. Place bird **breast-side down**, legs toward you.
2. Cut along one side of the backbone from tail to neck.
3. Cut along the other side and remove backbone.
4. Flip bird **breast-side up**.
5. Press firmly on the breastbone until it cracks and lies flat.
6. Tuck wing tips behind the breast to prevent burning.

## Why It Works

- Faster cook time
- More even doneness
- Better skin exposure for crisping

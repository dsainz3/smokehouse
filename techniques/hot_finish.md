# Hot Finish (High-Heat Crisping)

A hot finish after smoking helps crisp skin and improve texture.

## Options

### Smoker Finish

- Raise smoker to **400–450°F**
- Finish **8–15 minutes**
- Watch closely

### Grill / Sear Finish

- Move to direct heat (medium-high)
- Finish **2–5 minutes per side**
- Best for poultry skin and pork chops

## Notes

- If your recipe contains sugar, it can burn quickly.
- Cook to internal temp first; hot finish is for texture.

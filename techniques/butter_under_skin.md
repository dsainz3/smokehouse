# Butter Under the Skin (Poultry)

Putting butter under the skin boosts browning and keeps lean poultry (especially breast) juicy.

## Steps

1. Gently separate skin from meat with your fingers (avoid tearing).
2. Add softened butter under the skin (plain or herb/garlic butter).
3. Spread evenly over breasts and thighs.
4. Smooth skin down and season the outside.

## Notes

- Works great for chicken and Cornish hens.
- Combine with a hot finish for crisp skin.
